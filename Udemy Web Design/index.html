  <p><em>Skill is Being <strong>Amazing</strong></em></p>
  <!--Rather than using <i></i> class to italicize use <em></em>. Emphasis(em) is not just about style but also convey's more information.-->
  <p>To some I am amazing and others not. But I think I am pretty incredible. I may be tooting my own horn here but as you can see I am making something. I am making this website and through it all I am making something better of myself. I believe anyone who has the motivation to make something of themselves
    is truly <strong>Amazing</strong>.  I am a Airman in the <a href="https://www.todaysmilitary.com/ways-to-serve/service-branches/air-force-reserve"> AirForce Reserves </a> AirForce Reserves trying to work my way up the chain to become a Staff Sergeant in Aerospace Ground Equipment maintaining. I love my job as a mechanic, somedays I don't because more than anything I am still learning. With learning such a job with
    many units to maintain I make mistakes.  Thankfully nothing irreparable. I used to call myself a college student but with COVID and my feelings towards the crooked education system, I won't be returning.  More than anything though, I have no idea what I want to do with my life on a career basis.
    So I am self-learning.  Self-learning is hard but hard in the sense of motivation, and putting time into it.</p>

  <p>The reason for walking such a path as this, into the world of coding and Web Development is because it seems interesting.  Something I can endlessly get better at, learn from, be creative, and something I feel like could broaden my horizons.  Also way better than doing customer service the rest of my life.</p>
